Executive Summary: Security incident involving potentially suspicious network activity detected. Immediate actions required to contain potential threat by blocking indicators and isolating systems. Further investigation needed to determine full scope and impact.

A. Immediate Actions (First 1â€“2 hours)

Block domain at-uat.myaspect.net at Firewall/Proxy/DNS Filter levels.
Check reputation of domain at-uat.myaspect.net using VirusTotal or other TI source.
Isolate system zscaler-nss from the network (via EDR, VLAN change, or port disable) to contain potential threat.
Monitor account extern.samehta@adnoc.ae closely for suspicious activity. Consider temporary disablement if high risk is confirmed.
Capture volatile memory and disk image from key involved system(s) for forensic analysis.

B. Future Steps (Next 24 hours)
Investigation Steps

Review DNS logs (Windows Event Log or Sysmon ID 22) across endpoints for queries related to at-uat.myaspect.net or similar variations.

  - Domain at-uat.myaspect.net identified as key indicator

Audit Azure AD sign-in and UAL logs for user extern.samehta@adnoc.ae, focusing on unusual times, locations, or application access.

  - User extern.samehta@adnoc.ae involved in 87 logged activities

Investigate process execution logs (Security Event ID 4688 or Sysmon ID 1) on host zscaler-nss around the time of the incident.

  - Device zscaler-nss mentioned 100 times in logs

Search EDR/Antivirus logs across the environment for alerts related to the identified indicators (domains, IPs, hashes).

  - Multiple indicators identified requiring environment-wide check

Analyze proxy logs for connections to identified malicious domains/URLs to understand user interaction.

  - Indicators include domains/URLs: ['at-uat.myaspect.net'], []
